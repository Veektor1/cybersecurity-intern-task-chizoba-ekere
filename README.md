## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive security assessment of **ClientHub**, a cloud-based CRM platform. The assessment was conducted with a "Security-First" mindset, specifically focusing on multi-tenant integrity and API security for a system scaling to support enterprise clients.

## Task Completion Checklist
- [x] **Part 1: Threat Model & Attack Surface Analysis**
  - Identified 5 critical surfaces; prioritized top 3 risks including BOLA/IDOR and Cloud Storage leaks.
- [x] **Part 2: Deep-Dive Security Analysis**
  - Technical breakdown of Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) with real-world incident parallels (Honda 2023 breach).
- [x] **Part 3: Incident Response Plan**
  - Developed a 60-minute triage plan, root cause analysis, and multi-role fix validation.
- [x] **AI Usage Documentation**
  - Transparent reporting of collaborative AI use and original analysis verification.

## Brief Note on Approach
As a student of Cybersecurity and Machine Learning at the University of Aberdeen, my approach centered on the **"Blast Radius"** of vulnerabilities in multi-tenant SaaS environments. I prioritized risks like BOLA/IDOR because they represent an existential threat to customer trust in a CRM. My analysis combines automated logic verification with human-centric incident response to provide a balanced, enterprise-ready security posture for ClientHub.
